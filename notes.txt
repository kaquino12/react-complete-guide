- Custom Components must be Upper Camel Case
- Components are only allowed to have one return element 
- Simple work around wrap multiple elements in <div>
- In adding CSS to components just import the CSS file
- In assigning the element to a css class use className not class
- Rendering Date object to html will cause issues try using methods like toISOString() on date object
- Put const or let variables into {} to display it in the html 
- React ensures that there is only one parameter per component which will hold all received attributes as properties hence the name props
